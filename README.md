# Text Launcher

A simple launcher with only text around. The text size increases when app launch count increases (also manually editable). Pressing home starts 'Search' (only if set as default launcher, this will change or be augmented).

Not complete yet.

TODO:
- Switch to Room for the database
- Make search more accessible
- Make 'Uninstall' work (forgot)
- Theme change doesn't affect the preference screen, it should
- Add more colors instead of just Night Mode
- Add options for font
- Add more features (undecided as of yet)
